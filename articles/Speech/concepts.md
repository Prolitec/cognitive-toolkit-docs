## Speech recognition modes
Microsoft's *Speech to Text* APIs support multiple modes of speech recognition. Choose the mode that produces the best recognition results for your application.

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| *interactive* | "Command and control" recognition for interactive user application scenarios. Users speak short phrases intended as commands to an application. |
| *dictation* | Continuous recognition for dictation scenarios. Users speak longer sentences that are displayed as text. Users adopt a more formal speaking style. |
| *conversation* | Continuous recognition for transcribing conversations between humans. Users adopt a less formal speaking style and may alternate between longer sentences and shorter phrases. |

For more information, see [Recognition Modes](api-reference-rest/bingvoicerecognition.md#recognition-modes) in the API reference.
